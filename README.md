# Brewery-DB

The goal of this project is to create a web page that allows the user to search for a local brewery, and the page to respond with information about that brewery. Including the city that it is located in, as well as the online rating of the brewery selected. 

Within Python, I used flask, as well as created a CSV file with Excel that stores the information for each brewery that python will pull from.
